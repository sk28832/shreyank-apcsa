### What does this repository contain?

This repository contains all of the assignments that I had completed as part of my Java oriented AP Computer Science A course in high school.

The class taught the following concepts:
1. Primitive Types
2. Using Objects
3. Boolean Expressions and if Statements
4. Iteration
5. Writing Classes
6. Arrays
7. ArrayList
8. 2D Array
9. Inheritance
10. Recursion

Each of these topics were deeply covered in class, and we were asked to complete a variety of programming assignments and exercises on the Eclipse IDE.
